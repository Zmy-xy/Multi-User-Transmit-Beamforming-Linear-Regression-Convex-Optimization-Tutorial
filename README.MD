This is the homework 2 of ELEC 5470 Convex Optimization. In this homework, we use convex optimization package in MATLAB to implement linear regression and multi-user transmit beamforming problem.

It could be a basic tutorial for using CVX package in MATLAB. Before trying these source code, user should first intall CVX for MATLAB properly. (http://cvxr.com/cvx/doc/install.html)

How to use these source code and how they work? Please refer to the report HW2.pdf.

Hope they help. Please note that, this work refers to the following works:
